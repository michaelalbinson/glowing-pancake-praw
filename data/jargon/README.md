# Jargon
There is a lot of jargon used on these forums, and we need to disambiguate them so we can classify them properly.

For the sake of science I have manually parsed out some of the generally more positive and negative terminology so that we can make more effective sentiment analysis guesses.

Note that generally speaking, "positive" and "bullish" as well as "negative" and "bearish" can be used interchangeably.
